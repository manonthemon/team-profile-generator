  ## Description 
  This is a simple, command line based application generating company employees profiles. It allows users to quickly generate a HTML page with profiles containing basic information about employees such as their names, ID numbers, roles, email addresses and other. Users can select from a list of three different job roles: manager, engineer and intern. 
  
  I've built this application to complete the weekly challenge during the 12th week of edX front-end development bootcamp. Developing this application helped me practice the following areas of front-end developement:

  - Using node.js to dynamically generate files.
  - Using tests to examine my application.
  - Using arrow JavaScript arrow functions.
  - Using object constructors.
